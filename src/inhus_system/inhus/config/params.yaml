### Cmd perturbation
  ratio_perturbation_cmd: 0.0
    #=> perturbate cmd_vel 0.2 <=> +/- 20% of cmd_vel value

### Check see robot
  fov: 180
    #=> field of view of the human in degrees and in [180;-180]
  check_see_robot_freq: 5.0
    #=> frequence at which the human checks if he sees the robot
  delay_forget_robot: 1.5
    #=> delay after the last time the robot has been seen to forget the robot pose

### TTC
  human_radius: 0.3
  robot_radius: 0.3
  dist_radius_inflation: 10
    #=> radius of both human and robot to compute TTC (Time To Collision)

### Attitude RANDOM
  b_random_chance_choose: 30
  b_random_try_freq: 0.5
    #=> b_random_chance_choose% chance every 1/b_random_try_freq seconds to choose a new goal

### Attitude STOP_LOOK
  b_stop_look_dist_near_robot: 2.0
    #=> distance from which stop goal and look at robot for some time
  b_stop_look_stop_dur: 2.0
    #=> duration look at robot before resuming goal

### Attitude HARASS
  b_harass_dist_in_front: 2.0
    #=> distance in front of robot as goal
  b_harass_replan_freq: 5.0
    #=> frequency to replan for goal in front of robot

### Changed too much
  blocked_ask_path_freq: 10.0
    #=> frequency ask global path when blocked
  absolute_path_length_diff: 1.0
    #=> if length difference between the path received and the previous stored path is less than this then concidered as "good global path"
  ratio_path_length_diff: 1.3
    #=> if length of received path is less than the length of previous stored path times this ratio then concidered as "good global path"

### Approach
  approach_dist: 1.5
    #=> when blocked, get close until this distance to the robot by ignoring it
  approach_freq: 3.0
    #=> frequency at which we either check if still block or replan w/o the robot
